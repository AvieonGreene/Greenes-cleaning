# Greenes-cleaning
For my project I decided to do a cleaning service because my parents had an idea of having a cleaning service and I want to be able to help them get it started and inspire them to make this a reality. So I want to give visitors services that will help them that they can't get from another website, which will be cleaning tips, reminders of why to keep a clean property, and why we are a better option than our competitors. 

For my features I have decided to add 

-visualize data in a user friendly way. (e.g. graph, chart, etc) which is a bar chart comparing how fast we clean their property compared to other companies. 

-For my second feature I decided to use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved) and for this i created a form for users to let us know how fast they want us to clean their property and if a user types numbers instead of letters for their name they will get an alert that letters are required not number. 

-And for my last feature I decided to give my visitors a laugh on the way out of my website and by doing that I retrieved data from a third-party API and used it to display something within your app, and by doing this i create a meme generator that grabs memes from reddit and displays them after user presses Get meme button. 

For our media queries I have added two for mobile (600px) and for tablet (750px).
